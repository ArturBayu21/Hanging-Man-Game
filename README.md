# Hanging-Man-Game

This hanging man game is pretty much the same with hanging man game in general. When you run the program, it will pick a random word from the hanging_man file which contains houndreds of words. The word that the computer choose will converted into a blank spaces (e.g car converted ted to _ _ _ ) and the user have to guess each word. If the user guess is wrong, their hanging man vigure will start to be drawn. If their vigure is drawn compleatly, the user will lose.
